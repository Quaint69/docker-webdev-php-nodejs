make me a compose yml that has these:

mariadb - myphpadmin
postgres - pgadmin
sqlite - phpliteadmin
mongodb - mongo express

php, installs composer
javascript/typescript - installs nodejs

==========================
0. ports are assigned 1000+ incrementally so we arent confused 
1. expose 3 ports in node for containers to expose port to host (like npm run dev)
2. make sure the php and node installs like npm install and itself are cached, make sure cache is globally accessible whenever project folder im doing
3. user = "root", password = "11111111" for mariadb, postgres, and sqlite, #mongoexpress always uses admin/pass so dont bother
4. php and node has different working directory
5. assign each language port to access or view the project development, like ports, /index.php or sample app.js for js/ts/node
6. dont use a base image, make sure everyone is a different container, just in a compose
7. these are the images to use in compose: 
	mariadb:10.11
	phpmyadmin:latest
	postgres:16-alpine
	dpage/pgadmin4:latest
	mongo:7
	mongo-express:latest
	vtacquet/phpliteadmin:latest
	
	node:24-alpine
	php:8.3-cli-alpine
