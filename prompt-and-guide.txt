make me a compose yml that has these:

mariadb - myphpadmin
postgres - pgadmin
sqlite - phpliteadmin
mongodb - mongo express

php, installs composer
javascript/typescript - installs nodejs

==========================
0. ports are assigned 1000+ incrementally so we arent confused 
1. expose 3 ports in node for containers to expose port to host (like npm run dev)
2. make sure the php and node installs like npm install and itself are cached, make sure cache is globally accessible whenever project folder im doing
3. user = "root", password = "11111111" for mariadb, postgres, and sqlite, #mongoexpress always uses admin/pass so dont bother
4. php and node has different working directory
5. assign each language port to access or view the project development, like ports, /index.php or sample app.js for js/ts/node
6. dont use a base image, make sure everyone is a different container, just in a compose
7. these are the images to use in compose: 
	mariadb:10.11
	phpmyadmin:latest
	postgres:16-alpine
	dpage/pgadmin4:latest
	mongo:7
	mongo-express:latest
	vtacquet/phpliteadmin:latest
	
	node:24-alpine
	php:8.3-cli-alpine
	
	
notes:
1. use docker desktop, CHECK LOGS (INSANELY HELPFUL)
2. use the CONTAINER TERMINAL (each one HAS a terminal), 
	common use case are [installing dependencies, modify the container]
3. 2 ways to use Docker:
== for using multi-container composer ==
1. assigning directrory for each container is a MUST
2. mind how command is created, could be a really powerful automation for setting environment

== for using a Base Image (alpine, ubuntu) OR mixed BaseImage + seperate container
1. nothing much, its just much harder to do this,
2. basically just a virtual machine, much harder or easier, but honestly you'd rather just do stuff locally than this..
	why? because things like non-webapp GUI isnt gonna work, or like installers generally works for every machine, or the container needs GPU for its purpose.

4. special node note (package.json): "dev": "next dev -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3333"
